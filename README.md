# Machine Learning Models for Identification of Conglomerate Crystals
This project aims to classify crystal structures as either conglomerates or non-conglomerates using tree-based machine learning models. Conglomerates are a unique class of crystal structures that exhibit specific properties, especially in chiral systems. This project leverages molecular and crystal descriptors to develop models capable of predicting these classifications, helping researchers understand and predict structural behaviours more effectively.

## Data Sources:
CSD (Cambridge Structural Database):
- Contains a vast repository of crystallographic data that provides the structural basis for this project. Training data is gained from Version 5.41 (November 2019), and unseen validation data is from Version 5.43 (November 2021).

Molecular Descriptors from RDKit:
- A way to represent the data gained from the CSD numerically based on molecular-related features.

Crystal Descriptors from ChiPi (Clever & Coquerel, 2020):
- Another way to represent the data gained from the CSD numerically based on crystal-related features.
